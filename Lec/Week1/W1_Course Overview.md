## Course Description

Explores data visualization as an artistic practice. Engage with interdisciplinary practices involving the mapping of data to aesthetic form, gaining inspiration from a wide range of topics as musical graphic/abstract notation, conceptual/instructional art, animation, social media analyses and computational sciences. Examines the database as a pervasive cultural and computer form. Students will learn how to manipulate and organize open source data, as well as engage in alternative forms of archiving. Through this hybrid process, students will work towards a summative data art project that is both aesthetically compelling and revelatory in its informational content.

This course will focus on Data Visualization and Sonification using JavaScript and p5.js. **Prerequisites**: FA/DATT 1010 3.00 or permission of course director.

**Course website**: Assignments and course materials for this course will be made available through [eClass. ](https://eclass.yorku.ca/eclass/)

## Learning Objectives

At the completion of the course, students will: 

- Enhance and refine data literacy skills
- Delve into the historical context and evolution of data visualization and data art
- Understand the fundamental principles of data visualization and sonification
- Be aware of the importance of the mapping relationship between abstract data and its representation
- Acquire and apply programming skills for data visualization/sonification using Javascript and p5.js

## Course Evaluation

15% Participation (Attendance and In-class contributions) 65% Assignments

- 15% Three Reading Reflections (5% each)
- 5% Data Report
- 45% Three Data Visualization Projects (15% each)

20% Final Project

**Participation**

A portion of the class will be devoted to a small group discussion of readings, and group critique of peer work and presentations. Students are responsible for actively and thoughtfully contributing to these discussions and critiques. Students will also receive participation credit for supporting other students in addressing technical challenges or coding questions via eClass, or in class sessions. Unless there is a valid reason such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., students are required to attend class.

**Assignments**

Students will be assigned a weekly assignment to be completed by **Tuesday at 11:59 pm** through eClass.

**Final Project**

Students will use concepts and techniques learned in class to create web/screen-based data art for their final project. Details of the final project deliverables are to be announced.

Lateness Penalty

Assignments received later than the due date will be penalized **5% of the value of the assignment per day** that the assignments are late. For example, if an assignment worth 20% of the total course grade is a day late, 1 point out of 20 (or 5% per day) will be deducted. Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc. will be entertained by the Course Director only when supported by written documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter).

Accommodations

Students who have provided a letter of accommodation stating a need for flexible deadlines may receive an extension for each assignment **only if the extension request is made prior to the due date**. Each extension is up to **2 days**.

## Academic Honesty and Integrity

York students are required to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity and they are expected to complete their work in an honest and responsible manner and avoid any behaviour that is in violation of [the Senate Academic Honestly Policy. Engaging](https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/academic-honesty-senate-policy-on/) in academic misconduct is subject to disciplinary actions under [the Senate Academic Honesty Policy. Please](https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/academic-honesty-senate-policy-on/) review the information and resources on [the Academic Integrity website.](https://www.yorku.ca/unit/vpacad/academic-integrity/)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Apps**

According to York’s Senate Policy on Academic Honesty, **using AI apps** such as ChatGPT, GPTs, DALL-E, among others to complete academic work **without your instructor’s knowledge or permission**, is considered to be **a breach of academic honesty**. More specifically, using text-generating tools (such as ChatGPT) would be considered to be cheating (Senate Policy, section 2.1.1) and using image generating tools (such as DALL-E) would be considered to be plagiarism (Senate Policy, section 2.1.3). 

You are encouraged to **keep all of your research notes and draft versions of your work**. You may be asked to present these if it is suspected that an AI app was used to help complete your work. These drafts can be used to show how this work developed, and to provide evidence that the work is your own.

**Plagiarism**

Plagiarism is defined as misusing another person’s published or unpublished work by presenting their ideas, writing or other intellectual property as one’s own without proper acknowledgement (Senate[ Policy on Academic Honesty, ](https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/academic-honesty-senate-policy-on/)section 2.1.3.). There are a number of acts that are considered to be plagiarism, for example:

- copying content word-for-word from a source without proper citation; 
- paraphrasing from a source without proper citation; 
- submitting work you have already submitted for another course without the instructor’s approval;  rewording someone else’s work which you submit as your own; 
- having a third party complete work in whole then submitting it as one’s own (also known as contract cheating). 

Although plagiarism is often thought to involve words and ideas, it can also involve **drawings, paintings, photographs, programming code, statistics, presentations, musical scores, among other types of content**. Even if the act of plagiarism was unintentional, you can still receive a penalty. To avoid plagiarism, keep good track of any outside sources you use, and ensure that you **cite sources properly**.


## Course Registration Survey

The goal of this [survey is](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehb8B9j-GgLnxNDLI6PAQRM4Ug8oCODg56-YjTBWVU0Y8I8Q/viewform) to understand your background and experiences with programming and data visualization. Please fill out the form by **January 11th at 11:59pm**. 

For those who cannot open the link with a warning, please access the link outside the campus networks. The issue happens only on the campus networks.
